                    <p>
                        To get started, a teacher simply uploads their syllabus as a PDF and clicks "Analyze" to let the AI identify the core goals of the class. Next, the students can paste in a few job descriptions from the industry they want to be ready for. The AI then compares the two, finding the specific skills that are missing from the current plan. At the same time, students log in to a simple dashboard where they click to rank which topics interest them most through a quick series of questions. Once all the information is submitted, the website generates a list of ready-to-use lesson plans, homework assignments, and project ideas that blend the teacher's original goals with real-world career skills and student interests. The teacher can then click to tweak or edit any part of these suggestions to perfectly match their personal teaching style before saving the final version.
