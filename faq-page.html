                <h2>How does the AI analyze the syllabus and job descriptions?</h2>
                <p>
                    The AI uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse the text of the syllabus and job descriptions. It identifies key skills, topics, and learning objectives from the syllabus, and then compares them to the skills and requirements listed in the job descriptions. This allows it to find gaps in the curriculum where relevant industry skills are missing.
                </p>
                <h2>Can teachers customize the AI-generated lesson plans?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes! The AI provides a list of suggested lesson plans, homework assignments, and project ideas based on the analysis. Teachers can review these suggestions and make any adjustments they see fit to better align with their teaching style and course objectives before finalizing the curriculum.
                </p>
                <h2>How does the student preference feature work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Students log in to a dashboard where they answer a series of questions about their interests and career aspirations. The AI uses this information to further tailor the lesson plans and activities, ensuring that the curriculum not only aligns with industry demands but also resonates with what students are passionate about.
                </p>
                <h2>Is the platform secure for teachers and students?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, the platform implements secure authentication and data protection measures to ensure that all user information is kept safe. Teachers and students can confidently use the platform knowing that their data is protected.
                </p>
                <h2>Can this platform be adapted for different languages and job markets?</h2>
                <p>
                    While the initial version focuses on the English job market, the underlying technology can be adapted to analyze syllabi and job descriptions in other languages and regions. This would allow the platform to serve a global audience and cater to the specific needs of different job markets.
